What is EGL:
EGL (Embedded Graphics Library) is a free and open-source graphics library for embedded systems. It provides you with everything you need to create a user interface (GUI) that can be used in small- to large-scale applications and has easy-to-use graphical widgets, eye-catching visual effects, and a small memory footprint.

The architecture of EGL was inspired by WPF, and the styling came from CSS. Technology and behavioral activities are combined in the EGL.


# EGL Spotlights:
EGL is portable and compatible with a range of microcontrollers, from 8-bit models like the Arduino, Pic, and AVR to 32-bit models like the esp32 and stm32.
⋅EGL is compatible with any color, grayscale, or monochrome display.

⋅⋅*EGL supports a variety of screens.

⋅⋅*Any touchscreen technology is supported by EGL

⋅⋅*EGL supports objects and windows (e.g. buttons, charts, lists, sliders, images, etc.)

⋅⋅*Basic geometric functions are provided in 16 distinct typefaces and are integrated and free on the system interface (e.g. line, circle, frame, etc.)

⋅⋅*can be easily converted to nearly any microcontroller system without the need for dangerous dynamic memory allocation

⋅⋅*Utilize with any microcontroller or display thanks to hardware independence

⋅⋅*Scalable: having a low memory requirement (64 kB Flash, 16 kB RAM)
