What is EGL:
EGL (Embedded Graphics Library) is a free and open-source graphics library for embedded systems. It provides you with everything you need to create a user interface (GUI) that can be used in small- to large-scale applications and has easy-to-use graphical widgets, eye-catching visual effects, and a small memory footprint.

The architecture of EGL was inspired by WPF, and the styling came from CSS. Technology and behavioral activities are combined in the EGL.
